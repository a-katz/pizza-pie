traks.py:
 Now supports real-time adjustment of min/max blob size and thresholding.
It creates a window with buttons for control (toggle between normal image and threshold display)
and an image window with sliders for threshold level, min and max blob size.

animation.py
 Based on traks.py: click animation button to see (.png) images from the new "images" directory

(I removed the python code from this README file - PR)
